#+title: clif: The common lisp interactive fiction system
#+AUTHOR: Fernando Raul Rodriguez Flores
#+AUTHOR: Marian S. Álvarez Suri

#+TODO: HERE TODO | DONE

* Description
  In this file I'm going to write (in a literate programming style) the source code for clif: The common lisp interactive fiction system.

  Clif is a language designed for the creation of choose your own adventure stories.  The goal is to use them in the writing of the conferences of  mathematical courses.
  
  After the story is written in clif it will be possible to export it to several backends.  In the beginning, we are only going to use one backend: undum.

  We are going to use the library gagm.


* package definition

** description
   In this section we define the package for clif.
   
   So far (2024-10-23), we are just creating the package and using gagm.  We are not shadowing any symbols (for now).
** code
   #+begin_src lisp :results none :export code :tangle src/package.lisp
   (defpackage :clif
     (:use :cl :gagm))
   #+end_src


   

* utilities
** description
   In this section I'll add some basic utilities that will be used all over the system.

** declare the package in utilities.lisp
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r :results none :exports none :tangle src/utilities.lisp
   (in-package :clif)
   #+END_SRC

** symb,flatten and make-keyword
   
The first two utilities are symb and flatten.  The first one allows us to create symbols (useful for macro definitions), and flatten receives a tree and returns a flattened version of it.  It is useful in some macros.

*** mkstr and symb

   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r :results none :exports code :tangle src/utilities.lisp
   (defun mkstr (&rest args)
     "Returns a string with the concatenation of the args"
     (string-upcase
      (with-output-to-string (s)
        (dolist (a args) (princ a s)))))

   (defun symb (&rest args)
     "Returns a symbol formed by the concatenation of the args."
     (values (intern (apply #'mkstr args))))
   #+END_SRC

*** flatten
    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r :results none :exports code :tangle src/utilities.lisp
    (defun flatten (x)
      "Flattens a structure."
      (labels ((rec (x acc)
                 (cond ((null x) acc)
                       ((atom x) (cons x acc))
                       (t (rec (car x) (rec (cdr x) acc))))))
        (rec x nil)))
    #+END_SRC    

*** make-keyword
    The idea is to create a keyword like =:name=.

    To make a keyword you just need to insert the symbol into the =:keyword= package.

    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r :results none :exports code :tangle src/utilities.lisp
    (defun make-keyword (&rest args)
      (values (intern (apply #'mkstr args) :keyword)))
    #+END_SRC
    
** format-boxed
*** description
    This is a function very similar to format, but it prints two lines of `=', one above the format string and the other below.
*** code
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r :results none :exports code :tangle src/utilities.lisp
   (defun format-boxed (stream format-str &rest format-args)
     (let* ((string-to-print
             (if format-args
                 (apply 'format `(nil ,format-str ,@format-args))
                 (funcall 'format nil format-str)))
            (length (cl:+ 2 (length string-to-print)))
            (=-line (make-string length :initial-element #\=)))
       (format stream "~a~% ~a~%~a~2%"
               =-line string-to-print =-line)))

   (setf (symbol-function 'bformat) #'format-boxed)
   #+END_SRC   

** emacs-utils
*** description
    In this section I'll add the utilities to work with emacs.
*** code
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results none :exports code :tangle src/emacs-utils.el
   ;; key to insert (load everything.lisp) in the repl
   (define-key lisp-mode-map (kbd "M-m M-o M-l")
     (lambda ()
       (interactive)
       (insert "(load \"src/load-clif.lisp\") (in-package :clif)")))
   #+END_SRC
   

* macros
** documentation
In this section I'll add the macros that will be used in the code.  All src blocks will be tangled to src/macros.lisp
** add the package to the file
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r :results none :exports none :tangle src/macros.lisp
   (in-package :clif)
   #+END_SRC
** macro make-html-tag-constructor
*** description
The idea with this macro, is that when we create the constructor for an html-tag we need to separate the keywords in the content, that will represent the css-classes.  

We do that with a couple of loops, but I want to abstract that, because I did it twice already (for h1 and p) :grim:, and I need a third one (for link), so It is more than two times, which is the rule of thumb, so...  let's write that macro :-).

The idea (so far) is to be able to write something like:

#+begin_src lisp
(make-html-tag-constructor h1 (&rest contents)
  (make-instance 'html-h1
                 :css-classes css-classes
                 :contents actual-contents))
#+end_src

I want to leave it there, and not optimize it more, because I don't know if some other tags will need more parameters...  

The idea is:

#+begin_src lisp
(make-html-tag-constructor ctr-name lambda-list
  @body  ;; where you'll have css-classes and actual-contents
  ;; maybe you want to further process some of those lists
  ;; or I don't know :shrugs:
 )
#+end_src

Here is the hand-coded expected result:

   #+begin_src lisp :results none :export code 
   (defun h1 (&rest contents)
     (let* (css-classes
            actual-contents)
       ;; let's separate teh css-classes from the contents
       (loop for elt in contents
             doing
             (if (keywordp elt)
                 ;; if it is a keyword, let's store it as a downcase string 
                 (push (string-downcase (symbol-name elt)) css-classes)
                 ;; else
                 (push elt actual-contents)))
       ;; let's create the class
       (make-instance 'html-h1
                      :css-classes (reverse css-classes)
                      :contents (reverse actual-contents))))
   #+end_src

That should be the final result.

Let's code it :-)

*** code for the macro
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r :results none :exports none :tangle src/macros.lisp
   (defmacro make-html-tag-constructor (ctr-name (&rest lambda-list) &body body)
     "In the lambda list there should be an argument named contents, and it should be a list."
     `(defun ,ctr-name ,lambda-list
        (let* (css-classes
               actual-contents)
          ;; let's separate teh css-classes from the contents
          (loop for elt in contents
                doing
                (if (keywordp elt)
                    ;; if it is a keyword, let's store it as a downcase string 
                    (push (string-downcase (symbol-name elt)) css-classes)
                    ;; else
                    (push elt actual-contents)))
          ;; now let's reverse the css-classes and actual-contents
          (setf css-classes (reverse css-classes))
          (setf actual-contents (reverse actual-contents))
          ;; let's create the class
          ;; that should do it the final user
          ,@body)))
   #+END_SRC

*** test macro expansion
   #+begin_src lisp :results none :export code 
   (make-html-tag-constructor h1 (&rest contents)
     (make-instance 'html-h1
                    :css-classes css-classes
                    :contents actual-contents))
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src lisp
   (DEFUN H1 (&REST CONTENTS)
     (LET* (CSS-CLASSES ACTUAL-CONTENTS)
       (LOOP FOR ELT IN CONTENTS
             DOING (IF (KEYWORDP ELT)
                       (PUSH (STRING-DOWNCASE (SYMBOL-NAME ELT)) CSS-CLASSES)
                       (PUSH ELT ACTUAL-CONTENTS)))
       (SETF CSS-CLASSES (REVERSE CSS-CLASSES))
       (SETF ACTUAL-CONTENTS (REVERSE ACTUAL-CONTENTS))
       (MAKE-INSTANCE 'HTML-H1 :CSS-CLASSES CSS-CLASSES :CONTENTS
                      ACTUAL-CONTENTS)))
   #+end_src

** macro make-simple-html-tag-constructor
*** description
This macro is similar to the previous one, but the idea is that there are some html-tags for which there is nothing else to do than to create the instance.  For those very simple situations this macro does everything.

The idea is to be able to write:

#+begin_src lisp
(make-simple-html-tag-constructor h1 html-h1)
#+end_src

And that creates everything and we get the following:

   #+begin_src lisp :results none :export code 
   (defun h1 (&rest contents)
     (let* (css-classes
            actual-contents)
       ;; let's separate teh css-classes from the contents
       (loop for elt in contents
             doing
             (if (keywordp elt)
                 ;; if it is a keyword, let's store it as a downcase string 
                 (push (string-downcase (symbol-name elt)) css-classes)
                 ;; else
                 (push elt actual-contents)))
       (setf css-classes (reverse css-classes))
       (setf actual-contents (reverse actual-contents))
       ;; let's create the class
       (make-instance 'html-h1
                      :css-classes css-classes
                      :contents actual-contents)))
   #+end_src
   
This should work, at least with the html-tags that we have right now (h1 and p).

*** code for the macro
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r :results none :exports none :tangle src/macros.lisp
   (defmacro make-simple-html-tag-constructor (ctr-name class-name)
     `(make-html-tag-constructor ,ctr-name (&rest contents)
        (make-instance ',class-name
                       :css-classes css-classes
                       :contents actual-contents)))
   #+END_SRC

*** test macro expansion
   #+begin_src lisp :results none :export code 
   (make-simple-html-tag-constructor h1 html-h1)
   #+end_src
   Expands into:
   
   #+begin_src lisp
   (DEFUN H1 (&REST CONTENTS)
     (LET* (CSS-CLASSES ACTUAL-CONTENTS)
       (LOOP FOR ELT IN CONTENTS
             DOING (IF (KEYWORDP ELT)
                       (PUSH (STRING-DOWNCASE (SYMBOL-NAME ELT)) CSS-CLASSES)
                       (PUSH ELT ACTUAL-CONTENTS)))
       (SETF CSS-CLASSES (REVERSE CSS-CLASSES))
       (SETF ACTUAL-CONTENTS (REVERSE ACTUAL-CONTENTS))
       (MAKE-INSTANCE 'HTML-H1
                      :CSS-CLASSES CSS-CLASSES
                      :CONTENTS ACTUAL-CONTENTS)))
   #+end_src
And....  it works!  :-)
   
** macro make-html-tag-code-generator
*** description
Some html-tags can have css-classes.  Dealing with the code-generation for the css-classes can be cumbersome AND mechanic :-/.  This macro abstracts the creation of the css-classes and the contents in strings.

And also, we are dealing with html-tags, so we need to open and close them.

This macro works if the html-tag has css-classes and contents, and maybe something else.

The idea is to be able to use something like

#+begin_src lisp
(make-html-tag-code-generator link
   (format stream "<a class='~a' href=~a>~a</a>"
           css-classes
           (gcodenil target)
           contents-string))
#+end_src

and get:

#+begin_src lisp
(defmethod generate-code ((node link) (lang undum-language) stream)
  (let* ((css-classes-string
          (if (css-classes node)
              ;; then
              (with-output-to-string (s)
                (format s "~{~a~^ ~}"
                        (css-classes node)))
              ;; else
              ""))
         (contents-string (gcodenil contents)))
    (format stream "<a class='~a' href=~a>~a</a>"
            css-classes
            (gcodenil target)
            contents-string)))
#+end_src

Let's write the macro.

*** code for the macro
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r :results none :exports none :tangle src/macros.lisp
    (defmacro generate-code-for-html-tag (class-name &body body)
      "Creates the strings for css-classes and contents."
      `(defmethod generate-code ((node ,class-name) (lang undum-language) stream)
         (let* ((css-classes
                 (if (css-classes node)
                     ;; then
                     (with-output-to-string (s)
                       (format s "~{~a~^ ~}"
                               (css-classes node)))
                     ;; else
                     ""))
                (contents (gcodenil contents)))
           ,@body)))
   #+END_SRC

   #+begin_src lisp :results none :export code 
   (generate-code-for-html-tag link
      (format stream "<a class='~a' href=~a>~a</a>"
              css-classes
              (gcodenil target)
              contents))
   #+end_src

   #+begin_src lisp
   (DEFMETHOD GENERATE-CODE ((NODE LINK) (LANG UNDUM-LANGUAGE) STREAM)
     (LET* ((CSS-CLASSES
             (IF (CSS-CLASSES NODE)
                 (WITH-OUTPUT-TO-STRING (S)
                   (FORMAT S "~{~a~^ ~}" (CSS-CLASSES NODE)))
                 ""))
            (CONTENTS (GCODENIL CONTENTS)))
       (FORMAT STREAM "<a class='~a' href=~a>~a</a>" CSS-CLASSES (GCODENIL TARGET)
               CONTENTS)))
   #+end_src

   Let's test it with actual html-tags

** macro make-basic-html-tag-code-generator
*** description
We'll call an html-tag a basic-html-tag if it only contains contents and css-classes.

The code generation for this elements is very simple.

We only need the name of the class and the string of the html-tag.

With that information we could write something like:

=(make-basic-html-tag-code-generator html-h1 "h1")=

and get:

#+begin_src lisp
(defmethod generate-code ((node html-h1) (lang undum) stream)
   (format stream "<h1 class='~a'>~a</h1>"
           (if (css-classes node) (with-output-to-string (s)
                                    (format s "~{~a~^ ~}"
                                            (css-classes node)))
               "")
           (contents node)))
#+end_src

Let's write the macro.

*** code for the macro
   #+BEGIN_SRC lisp +n -r :results none :exports none :tangle src/macros.lisp
   (defmacro generate-code-for-simple-html-tag (class-name html-tag)

     `(defmethod generate-code ((node ,class-name) (lang undum-language) stream)
        (format stream "<~a class='~a'>~a</~a>"
                ,html-tag
                (if (css-classes node)
                    (with-output-to-string (s)
                      (format s "~{~a~^ ~}"
                              (css-classes node)))
                    ;; else
                    "")
                (gcodenil contents)
                ,html-tag)))
   #+END_SRC

                 "")
             (GCODENIL CONTENTS) "h1"))

* AST (the classes for a story)

** description
In this section we'll add the classes required to make a story in Undum.  (Maybe in future incarnations we'll have different exporters, but, for now, we are dealing with undum).

All the src blocks will be tangled to the file src/ast-nodes.lisp.

There are some elements in the AST that share elements.  The idea is to have some base classes in this section that are common to some of the elements in the AST.

**** initialization for the system
***** description
An undum "game" is made of two elements: a .js file with the situations and an html file, that is used to visualize the logic in the js.

This function genarates the html file needed for the game.  In a first iteration we are going to just duplicate the file that comes with undum.

Maybe in a future, I'll add a configuration file, where we can change some of these things.

There are some things that we changed from the original undum.

The first one is that now, the files undum.js, undum.css and jquery.js, and game.js should be in the same directory as the html file.

In the undum.css there are some images that are stored in a folder named img, that should also be on the same directory as everything else.

Maybe later, we can think of a better design for that, but so far, this are the facts.

Actually, I'm going to add those files to a folder assets in the git repository.

In fact, an actual initialize-system function should create the html AND copy all those elements to wherever the story si going to be held.  But, those are problems for the future.

* macros to create situations 

** description
The idea behind these macros is that we don't need to add manually the name of the situations to the list.  Let's let a macro do that.

We want something like:

   #+begin_src lisp :results none :export code
   (def-situation name_without_hiphens_nor_uppercases ;; wtf
       (p "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.  Pellentesque condimentum, magna ut suscipit hendrerit, ipsum augue ornare nulla, non luctus diam neque sit amet urna.  Curabitur lacinia pulvinar nibh.  Nulla posuere.  Etiam laoreet quam sed arcu.  "))
   #+end_src
      
And that creates a parameter named =name_without_hiphens_nor_uppercases= and binds it to the instance of the =basic-situation=.

Let's write that code \o/.

** code
   #+begin_src lisp :results none :export code :tangle src/macros.lisp
     (defmacro defbasic-situation (name &body instructions)
       (let* ((situation-id (substitute #\_ #\-
